## Resources I used to learn about arduino, IR sensors, distance calculation and C++

How does IR work, and how to use it with Arduino: https://www.makerguides.com/sharp-gp2y0a710k0f-ir-distance-sensor-arduino-tutorial/

IR sensor we are working with SEN0019: https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/dfrobot/SEN0019/6588507
